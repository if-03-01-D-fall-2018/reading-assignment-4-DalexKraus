        <h1>World Wide Web General</h1>
<u>test<u>
        <p>The essential technologies that made the World Wide Web a success were URL, HTTP and HTML</p><br>
        <strong>URL:</strong><p>The <strong>UniformResourceLocators</strong> is used to address specific resources on a web server through the internet using a domain or host name.</p>
        <strong>HTTP:</strong><p>The <strong>HyperTextTransferProtocol</strong> is used to send <i>.html</i> files, which contain the content of the website, from the server to the client.</p>
        <strong>HTML:</strong><p>The <strong>HyperTextMarkupLanguage</strong> is a computer language, which is used as a type of 'skeleton' for a website, which is interpreted by the web client, the browser.</p>

        <br><h3>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h3>
        <p>To locate or address specific pages, images or videos in a website, you have to use something what's called an <em>URL</em>.<br>
        <em>URL's </em>(<strong>Uniform Resource Locators</strong>) were defined in <i>RFC 1738</i> in 1994 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.<br>
        Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.<br>

        <h3>General components of an URL</h3>
        A typical URL could have the form <em>http://www.example.com/index.html</em>, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (<em>www.example.com</em>), and a file name (index.html).</p>

        <br><h2>Web Sever</h2>
        <h3>What is a web server?</h3>
        <p>Web server refers to server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can serve contents to the World Wide Web.<br>
        A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.<br>

        <h3>What does a web server?</h3>
        The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.<br>
        The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>
        Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.</p>

        <h3>How can content be stored on a web server?</h3>
        Web servers are able to map the path component of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into:<br>
         - A local file system resource (for static requests)<br>
         - An internal or external program name (for dynamic requests)<br>

        For a static request the URL path specified by the client is relative to the web server's root directory!<br>

        <br>Today websites are also able to support serverside scripts or applications such as <em>php</em>, <em>ruby</em> or <em>node.js</em>.<br></p>

        <br><h2>Web Client</h2>
        <h3>What is a web client?</h3>
        <p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.<br>
        Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct URL, enabling browsers to retrieve and display them on the user's device.</p>

        <br><h2>Hello World</h2>
        <h3>HTML-Head Element</h3>
        <p>The <em><strong>head</strong></em> tag is used as a container for meta data, and is set between the <em>html</em> and <em>body</em> tag</p>

        <h3>!DOCTYPE Element</h3>
        <p>The <em><strong>!DOCTYPE</strong></em> tag is used to signalize the browser, that he has to interpret this file as <b>HyperTextMarkupLanguage</b>.</p>

        <h3>The Head- and Body-Elements</h3>
        <p>The <em><strong>Head</strong></em> and <em><strong>Body</strong></em> Elements are the topmost elements in a html page.<br>
        The Body element contains all the website's content.</p>

        <h3>HTML-Head Element</h3>
        <p>The <em><strong>head</strong></em> tag is used as a container for meta data, and is set between the <em>html</em> and <em>body</em> tag</p>

        <h3>The <em>EM</em> Element</h3>
        <p>The em-Element is used to emphasize text in your website. You have to mark the emphasized text using the <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> tag.</p>

        <h3>The <strong>STRONG</strong> Element</h3>
        <p>The strong-Element is used to mark text in your website as important or bold. To use it, simply mark your text with the <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> tag.</p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>They can be specified by names (e.g. red) or by hexadecimal values. (e.g. #ffac4d)<br>
        They are specified by the rule 'color'.<br>
        Same can be used for the rule 'background-color'!</p>

        <br><h2>Text alignment</h2>
        <p>Text can be aligned by using the rule 'text-alignment' and all acceptable values are 'right, left, center and justify'</p>

        <br><h2>Text decoration</h2>
        <p>Text can be decorated using underlines, overlines and strike-troughs.<br>
        Using the rule 'text-decoration' the decoration of a text can be set.</p>

        <br><h2>Font weights</h2>
        <p>A font can be marked as heavier, using the 'weight' tag.</p>

        <br><h2>Text transformations</h2>
        <p>Texts can be transformed by using the 'text-transform' rule.<br>
        Acceptable values are 'uppercase', 'lowercase' and 'capitalize'.
        </p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Unordered Lists</strong> use with the <em>ul</em> tag.
          Every item in a list has to be marked using the tag <em>li</em>!
          Unordered Lists don't have a numeration for each entry, for this you have to use the <em>ol</em> tag.<br>
          The icon of a bullet mark can be changed using a css-rule: <code>list-style-type</code>
          Possible values are <em>disc, circle, square, none</em>.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Ordered Lists</strong>
          This list gives every entry a specific index number.
          This type of number can be changed using the attribute <code>type</code>.<br>
          Possible values for types are:
          <ul>
            <li>1 - Every entry is given a number</li>
            <li>A - Every entry is given an uppercase letter</li>
            <li>a - every entry is given a lowercase letter</li>
            <li>I - every entry is given a uppercase roman letter</li>
            <li>i - every entry is given a lowercase roman letter</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <p>
        An HTML table is defined with the <em>table</em> tag.<br>
        Each table row is defined with the <em>tr</em> tag.<br>
        A table header is defined with the <em>th</em> tag.<br>
        By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the <em>td</em> tag.<br>
        Borders can be set using the css rule <em>border</em>.<br>
        Example: <code>border: 1px solid black</code>.<br>
        If you want the borders to collapse into one border, add the CSS <code>border-collapse</code> property and set it to <code>collapse</code>.
